		The study of philosophy enhances a person's problem-solving capacities. 
		It helps us to analyze concepts, definitions, arguments, and problems.
		 It contributes to our capacity to organize ideas and issues, to deal with questions of value, 
		 and to extract what is essential from large quantities of information.

			The study of philosophy enhances a person's problem-solving capacities.
			 It helps us to analyze concepts, definitions, arguments, and problems.
			 It contributes to our capacity to organize ideas and issues, to deal with questions of value, 
			and to extract what is essential from large quantities of information. It helps us, on the one hand,
			 to distinguish fine and subtle differences between views and, on the other hand, 
			 to discover common ground between opposing positions. 
			 It also helps us to synthesize a variety of views or perspectives into one unified whole.

			The study of Philosophy has helped people with anxiety, depression and a myriad of other things.
			It also challenges the reader to think at a higher level of thinking, helping them find their place,
			purpose and duty and life. It allows us to consider and find what is truly imporatant to us in life.

			Of course not all philosophies is apllicable to a person, so it is recommended to take what is useful,
			discard what is not and keep what is uniquely your own. I personally, follow the teachings from Stoicism, 
			Zen Buddhism, and The Tao Te Ching, though they may seem different but they all preach the same thing, 
			being mindfull, stop worrying excesively, especially about the future and things outisde my control, and 
			living a life of virtue.

			Every person has a different understanding, a different path, and a different way to find meaning. Some 
			may find it inside them, on others, or on a task or mission. Philososphy just makes it easier.
